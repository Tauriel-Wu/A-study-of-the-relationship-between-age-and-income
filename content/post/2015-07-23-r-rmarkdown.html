<h1>Abstract:</h1>
<p>We analyzed the 2019 CES Web data, selected the variables, and made a linear regression model. We found that their is no linear relationship between age and income, which can help us evaluate the quality of life of people with different ages.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Income is one of the most important determinant of living standard. As a developed country, we faces the same problem as most other developed countries –aging of population. It leads to a challenge to our country, since we should not only consider the country’s spending and financial issues, but also need to be concerned about the living conditions about elders. From other studies, they estimate that the number of elder people in Canada will increase to 23% of our total population in 2030. (Elderly Poverty, The conference Board of Canada) Therefore, it is really important to know the economic situation of elder people, since if we estimate that the elder people may face financial problems, our country have to find a solution as soon as possible. Base on our study, we don’t find that there exist a linear relationship between age and income.</li>
<li>In this study, we investigated the 2019 Canadian Election Study, the data I analyzed is from ex post-data of an election, it is still important since it contains a lot of useful information and by analyzing it, we can learn more about the political situation recently.(Hodgetts, Paul, and Rohan Alexander. “Cesr: An R Package for the Canadian Election Study.” SocArXiv, 3 Sept. 2020. Web.) I looked at income(in canadian dollar) and age(in year). Base on these two variables, we found that there is no linear relationship between age and income.</li>
<li>We analyzed the data about income and age independently first. After cleaned the missing value of these two variables, we found that the income of most people is in the range of 3 to 12 million, and the most people in Canada is between 30 - 60 years old. When we combine two variables together, we analyzed that there is not a significant relationship between them. This is may because our data still includes a lot of wrong values which may largely impact the result. Additionally, we did not concern about some other important determinant of income such as people’s education, race, gender, and living area.</li>
