      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>-Code and data supporting this analysis is available at:https://github.com/Tauriel-Wu/A-study-of-the-relationship-between-age-and-income.git
Abstract: We analyzed the 2019 CES Web data, selected the variables, and made a linear regression model. We found that their is no linear relationship between age and income, which can help us evaluate the quality of life of people with different ages.
 Introduction  Income is one of the most important determinant of living standard. As a developed country, we faces the same problem as most other developed countries â€“aging of population.</description>
